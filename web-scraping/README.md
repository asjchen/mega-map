# Web Scraping

This subdirectory contains all code related to web scrapers. 

## County Website Scraping

The county-scraping subdirectory contains examples of scripts/Jupyter notebooks that scrape data (often lists of county resources) from websites. 

## Site Monitoring

The site-monitoring folder contains prototype code for monitoring a set of websites for changes and sending an email notification if changes are detected. This was originally prototyped to monitor changes in school meal information on district websites. It has not been deployed.
